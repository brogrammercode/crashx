## Brogrammer  

<p>
A passionate software craftsman on a relentless quest to learn, build, and master.  
Every day is an upgrade. Every challenge is a new language.  
I live in the infinite playground of computer science -  where curiosity writes the code, and ambition debugs the limits.

### 💠 What I’ve Honed So Far

I build robust software systems and dynamic web applications using **Python** (**FastAPI**, **Flask**, **Django**) and **TypeScript** (**Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Nest.js**), backed by **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**. I bring these systems to life with sleek, responsive frontends in **Next.js** and **React.js**, sometimes craft cross-platform mobile application experiences with **Flutter** and integrate **AI**, leveraging **LLMs** like **LLaMA** and **Gemini** for intelligent, automated solutions.
